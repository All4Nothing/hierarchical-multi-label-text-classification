0	conair cs15tcs professional straight styles straightening iron woah ! sure this straightener looks like all the other crappy straightners in the world , but there 's a twist to this one ! it is my first straightner and i 've had it for about 7 months . i bought it only because i was desperate for a cheap straightener because my hair is very thick , long , wavy ! i 'm looking for a new straighner right now ... but until then this one is doing just fine . if it works for me , it will work for you !
1	barbie ballet shoes icon doll i was looking round the toysrus website and found this cheap doll ! " wow " i said . so i got it and her body is painted on ! which is really cute ! , parents would n't you like to get a toy where you save yourself from picking up another barbie item from the floor ! well , make a cardboard dancefloor and she can do her piroettes happily . her shoes are very pretty ! , pink with laces ! her hair is very good quality and easy to style ! get her !
2	cloud b twilight constellation night light i bought this item because it had good reviews , and looked really cool . it 's a turtle with 3 different colored led lights on the inside that are supposed to project stars in a room or on a ceiling . of the 3 colors green , amber and blue only the green and blue are noticable in pitch black . the amber is almost a waisted option because you ca n't see it . my problem with this item is it only works in pitch black , and barely in that case . the product shots show it sitting on a nursery floor shining up at the ceiling , this is sooooo impossible . the turtle needs to be at least 2 feet from the ceiling in order to see any of the stars . a total disappointment . i returned it .
3	alessi zuppa toscana tuscan white bean soup ( pack of 6 ) this soup taste great . even better if you add the olive oil and grated parm cheese . only takes about 15 mins to make . the package arrived quick . ordered on sunday night , had tuesday morning ( used prime , 2 shipping ) a day early . i will probably order a few more boxes very soon .
4	swedish beauty amaretto tanning lotion advanced dark tanning system with triple bronzer and shimmer i ordered this because i was running low on my current tanning lotion which i love and it smells like skittles , so i read the reviews for this one that was supposed to smell like cherries or almonds and it does not smell like either . it just has a chemical odor and has so much bronzer in it that i really have to make sure to wipe my hands off . i will definitely be ordering some more of my original lotion to replace this nasty stuff .
5	stash green white tea blends , 18 or 20 count tea bags ( pack of 6 ) i 've been tasting along several green tea 's trying to find one that i liked . i was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks . one would be too strong , the other too bland . i think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass , making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil . i found the mint to be nicely pronounced , and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable , with a little bit of honey it 's really good . so if you 're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine , and like me you like it mildly paired with mint . then give this tea a shot . ( i do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first , so that you 're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine )
