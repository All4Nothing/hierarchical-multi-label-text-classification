0	conair cs15tcs professional straight styles straightening iron woah ! sure this straightener looks like all the other crappy straightners in the world , but there 's a twist to this one ! it is my first straightner and i 've had it for about 7 months . i bought it only because i was desperate for a cheap straightener because my hair is very thick , long , wavy ! i 'm looking for a new straighner right now ... but until then this one is doing just fine . if it works for me , it will work for you !
1	barbie ballet shoes icon doll i was looking round the toysrus website and found this cheap doll ! " wow " i said . so i got it and her body is painted on ! which is really cute ! , parents would n't you like to get a toy where you save yourself from picking up another barbie item from the floor ! well , make a cardboard dancefloor and she can do her piroettes happily . her shoes are very pretty ! , pink with laces ! her hair is very good quality and easy to style ! get her !
2	cloud b twilight constellation night light i bought this item because it had good reviews , and looked really cool . it 's a turtle with 3 different colored led lights on the inside that are supposed to project stars in a room or on a ceiling . of the 3 colors green , amber and blue only the green and blue are noticable in pitch black . the amber is almost a waisted option because you ca n't see it . my problem with this item is it only works in pitch black , and barely in that case . the product shots show it sitting on a nursery floor shining up at the ceiling , this is sooooo impossible . the turtle needs to be at least 2 feet from the ceiling in order to see any of the stars . a total disappointment . i returned it .
3	alessi zuppa toscana tuscan white bean soup ( pack of 6 ) this soup taste great . even better if you add the olive oil and grated parm cheese . only takes about 15 mins to make . the package arrived quick . ordered on sunday night , had tuesday morning ( used prime , 2 shipping ) a day early . i will probably order a few more boxes very soon .
4	swedish beauty amaretto tanning lotion advanced dark tanning system with triple bronzer and shimmer i ordered this because i was running low on my current tanning lotion which i love and it smells like skittles , so i read the reviews for this one that was supposed to smell like cherries or almonds and it does not smell like either . it just has a chemical odor and has so much bronzer in it that i really have to make sure to wipe my hands off . i will definitely be ordering some more of my original lotion to replace this nasty stuff .
5	stash green white tea blends , 18 or 20 count tea bags ( pack of 6 ) i 've been tasting along several green tea 's trying to find one that i liked . i was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks . one would be too strong , the other too bland . i think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass , making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil . i found the mint to be nicely pronounced , and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable , with a little bit of honey it 's really good . so if you 're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine , and like me you like it mildly paired with mint . then give this tea a shot . ( i do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first , so that you 're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine )
6	mama mio tummy rub stretch mark butter , 4 oz , say no to stretch marks ! i started with the mama mio oil and loved it so much i had to try the belly butter . it 's wonderful . smells great and absorbs really well . on days when i really want to make my belly soft i use the oil followed by the belly butter . i 've tried several on the market and this is the best . wish it was n't so pricey ... but that 's my only beef with it .
11	homedics bubble spa massaging bubble mat i wish i could rate this as no stars . it was a disappointment more so because it was such a great idea , and i was hoping for a carefree relaxing bath . first off , the huge vacuum with the hose out the back end was loud . o.k. , i thought , so it 's loud but i stuck the multitude of small little suction cups on the bottom of the tub and got in . with the tub filled , the mat had to be held down by brute force and a number of times , the hose popped off the mat . it was somewhat massaging but the air bubbles cooled the water to an uncomfortable temperature and the heat setting did not do a whit of difference . the handy suction cup holder to keep the remote out of the water . ( who ever would think a tub spa 's remote would not handle a dunk in the water ? ) well i read the instructions carefully and the remote immediately needed to be dried off and the batteries taken out and dried and the whole thing needs time to dry . the next time i tried it ( yes i was determined ) i got the whole tub floor wet and pushed down on all 24 or so of those little suction cups and tried it again . still the same story . as i try to push down on the part of the mat coming up by my feet , the part by my head comes up . i end up having to lie there totally flat while the mat bubbles come up around me cooling my nice hot bath water . the hose pops off yet again and i go to use the remote ( which is this time not in the precarious holder ) and sick and tired of all the faults already i try to turn it off and the remote does n't even work . this is not relaxing .
25	diaper dude diaper bag my husband did n't care that much about what baby gear i bought , as long as i made a reasonable effort to be cost effective . but when i told him about this bag he was dare i say excited when it arrived . i could tell he really appreciated the thought when i got him a " man bag . " and i like it , too , it 's nice and neutral . i love the fact that it 's a messenger bag because totes are always sliding off my small shoulders .
27	andis rc 2 ionic 1875w ceramic hair dryer with folding handle and retractable cord i first used this hair dryer at a hotel i stayed in recently . i liked it so much that i did an online search for it and discovered that amazon carried it . it has a nice feel in the hand , not too heavy , with a comfortable handle . i really like that it has 3 " speeds . " it also has a cool blast button , but i do n't use that . it is also quite quiet for a hair dryer . one of the best features is the retractable cord . now i do n't have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet . i bought this dryer even though i had recently bought a revlon that i was n't crazy about because it was too large and quite loud . very happy with this ! i hope it lasts as long as my conair that died after 15 or so years .
